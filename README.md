# Black Ops II: a collection of information and modified files
This repository is a place for me to post helpful information and modified code for use on custom Black Ops II servers.

Most of the uncompiled GSC files come from JezuzLizard's repository. Any GSC files I post here will be personally modified in some way to achieve some goal.

In addition to GSC files, I will also post tutorials and important information I have learned along the way.

To see some of the code in action, feel free to join my servers on Plutonium by searching for "lizardpeter" in the server browser.
